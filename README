This is the MSPGCC Branch of the code. It has a different directory structure and content.

This is a simple RF library for TI Launchpad w / RF Boosterpack running MSP430G2553.

I started writing my own library, but then I was told of a TI-library
with BSD-license that were more compatible across multiple chips. This library is at:

http://www.ti.com/general/docs/litabsmultiplefilelist.tsp?literatureNumber=slaa325a 
  
I have now deleted my original files, and have included the TI-files here as a
library under the directory /ti (so I'm not the copyright-holder of the files in
the /ti-directory, and not the original author). 

All files are licensed under BSD, including both the TI-files and my own. 
Please see the headers of the files for more information. I have made some 
modifications to the TI-files to make it work with the Launchpad and MSP430G2553

I am going to make a few test-apps that I will put under the directory /apps
These test-apps are based on test-code from TI, and are also available as BSD. 

Thanks to CorB for testing, contributing source code and helping out.
